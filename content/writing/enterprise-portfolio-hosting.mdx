# Why I Hosted My Portfolio Like an Enterprise Service (And Kept It Cheap)

## Quick Summary

- **Key Point 1**: Using S3 + CloudFront delivers enterprise reliability and performance at a fraction of EC2/ECS costs
- **Key Point 2**: "Enterprise" means automation, security headers, monitoring, and budgets—not just expensive compute
- **Key Point 3**: TTFB under 50ms globally and sub-5-minute deploys are achievable on a $3/month budget

## Context

### Background

When I set out to build my portfolio site, I had a choice: follow the traditional path of spinning up an EC2 instance or ECS cluster, or architect it like I would a production service at work—with the same rigor, just different scale.

Most developers reach for what&apos;s familiar: a VPS, Docker container, or managed hosting platform. These work, but they miss an opportunity to demonstrate infrastructure thinking. I wanted my portfolio to be a signal of how I approach production systems.

The constraint? Keep it cheap enough that I wouldn&apos;t think twice about the monthly bill.

### Requirements

My requirements were clear:

**Business requirements:**

- Sub-$10/month operating cost
- Zero manual maintenance
- Professional first impression (fast, secure, reliable)

**Technical requirements:**

- Global edge distribution (sub-100ms TTFB for most users)
- Automated deployments from Git push
- Security headers and HTTPS
- Infrastructure as code (no ClickOps)

**Performance needs:**

- First Contentful Paint under 1 second
- Deploy-to-live in under 5 minutes
- 99.9%+ uptime

**Timeline constraints:**

- Initial setup: one weekend
- Ongoing maintenance: < 1 hour/month

### Stakeholders

Just me—but I was optimizing for hiring managers and technical leads who would view this portfolio. They needed to see:

- Infrastructure competence
- Cost awareness
- Production-ready thinking
- Automation mindset

## The Decision

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: EC2 / Lightsail VPS

**Description**: Traditional approach—spin up a t3.micro or Lightsail instance, run NGINX, deploy via SSH or rsync.

**Pros:**

- Familiar to most developers
- Full control over the runtime
- Easy to understand and debug
- Works with any stack

**Cons:**

- ~$5-10/month minimum for reliable instance
- Need to manage OS updates, security patches
- Single point of failure without additional cost
- Manual SSL certificate management
- No automatic global distribution
- Wastes compute for a static site

**When this makes sense**: Dynamic applications, server-side rendering needs, databases, or when you need persistent compute.

#### Option 2: ECS Fargate / App Runner

**Description**: Containerize the site, run on AWS managed container services.

**Pros:**

- Modern, container-native approach
- Automatic scaling (if needed)
- Better separation of concerns
- Easy CI/CD integration

**Cons:**

- Minimum ~$15-20/month for Fargate
- Overkill for static content
- Still running compute for files that don&apos;t change
- Additional complexity (container registry, task definitions)
- Higher operational overhead than needed

**When this makes sense**: Microservices, APIs, applications that need to scale compute independently, SSR requirements.

#### Option 3: S3 + CloudFront + Route53

**Description**: Host static files on S3, distribute via CloudFront CDN, DNS via Route53. Fully serverless.

**Pros:**

- Cost scales with actual usage (~$1-5/month for typical portfolio traffic)
- Global edge network included
- Automatic HTTPS via ACM
- 99.99% S3 durability
- No servers to patch or maintain
- Infrastructure as code friendly (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Built-in versioning and rollback

**Cons:**

- Static content only (no SSR without Lambda@Edge)
- Requires understanding of S3 bucket policies, CloudFront behaviors
- Cache invalidation adds complexity
- Not suitable for dynamic backends

**When this makes sense**: Static sites, SPAs, portfolios, documentation, marketing sites.

### The Choice

I chose **S3 + CloudFront + Route53** for several reasons:

**Deciding factors:**

1. **Cost alignment**: A portfolio doesn&apos;t need to burn money on idle compute. With CloudFront&apos;s free tier (1TB transfer/month), S3 costs (pennies for storage), and Route53 ($0.50/month), total cost stays under $3/month.

2. **Enterprise patterns at scale**: This is the same pattern used by high-traffic production sites. I&apos;m using the same tools, just at a different scale.

3. **Performance wins**: CloudFront&apos;s 450+ edge locations mean my site loads fast globally without any tuning.

4. **Zero maintenance**: No OS to patch, no servers to reboot, no monitoring CPU utilization.

**How was the decision validated?**

- Deployed a test version, measured TTFB from multiple regions (all under 80ms)
- Ran a load test: sustained 1000 req/s without breaking a sweat
- Checked AWS Cost Explorer after first month: $1.73 total

**What made this the right choice for this context?**
This is a static portfolio. The content changes weekly at most. There&apos;s no database, no user sessions, no server-side logic. Using compute for this would be like using a forklift to move a coffee mug.

### Implementation Approach

**Migration strategy**: Started fresh (new project)

**Rollout plan:**

1. Set up Terraform repository with S3, CloudFront, ACM, Route53
2. Build site locally, sync to S3
3. Configure CloudFront distribution with security headers
4. Point DNS, verify HTTPS
5. Add GitHub Actions CI/CD
6. Set up CloudWatch alarms and budget alerts

**Risk mitigation steps:**

- Version all infrastructure with Terraform state in S3
- Enable S3 versioning for rollback capability
- Created CloudFront invalidation automation (no manual cache clearing)
- Set budget alert at $10/month (10x expected cost)

**Success criteria:**

- Deploy time under 5 minutes
- TTFB under 100ms for North America and Europe
- Perfect Lighthouse scores (100 across the board)
- Monthly cost under $5

## Tradeoffs

### What We Gained

**Performance improvements:**

- TTFB: 35-80ms globally (was 200-500ms on previous Netlify setup)
- Deploy time: 3.5 minutes average (Git push to live)
- 100/100 Lighthouse performance score
- Zero cold starts (unlike Lambda-based solutions)

**Cost optimization:**

- Monthly cost: $1.73 average (vs $5 minimum on VPS)
- No surprise bills—predictable scaling costs
- Free tier covers 1TB transfer (would cost $85/month on EC2)

**Operational wins:**

- Zero downtime deploys (CloudFront invalidation is gradual)
- Automatic global failover (S3 handles replication)
- Built-in DDoS protection (AWS Shield Standard)
- No maintenance windows
- Infrastructure version controlled

**Long-term benefits:**

- Same patterns scale to production workloads
- Demonstrates cloud-native thinking
- Easy to extend (Lambda@Edge for dynamic features if needed)
- Portfolio becomes a reference architecture

### What We Gave Up

**No server-side rendering:**

- Can&apos;t generate personalized content per request
- Dynamic meta tags would require Lambda@Edge ($0.60 per million requests)
- No A/B testing without additional services

**Increased infrastructure complexity:**

- Need to understand CloudFront behaviors, S3 policies, ACM validation
- Cache invalidation requires understanding CloudFront&apos;s model
- Debugging is different (no logs on a server, must use CloudFront logs)
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with CDN patterns

**Deployment workflow changes:**

- Must invalidate CloudFront cache (adds 30-60s to deploys)
- Can&apos;t SSH to troubleshoot
- Rollback means re-deploying previous version (though with S3 versioning, this is automated)

### The Balance

For a static portfolio, these tradeoffs are heavily in favor of the serverless approach:

**Why the gains outweighed the costs:**

- The "complexity" is learning production cloud patterns—valuable regardless
- SSR isn&apos;t needed for a portfolio (static site generation handles SEO)
- The cost savings (60-80% vs compute) compound over years
- Performance gains are measurable and matter for first impressions

**Why the timing was right:**

- Terraform maturity made IaC approachable
- CloudFront free tier changed the economics
- GitHub Actions eliminated need for separate CI/CD service

**What&apos;s context-specific:**
This works for static content. If I needed:

- User authentication → would add Cognito or Auth0
- Form handling → would add Lambda functions or FormSpree
- Analytics → CloudFront logs + Athena or external service
- Comments → would use external service (Giscus, Utterances)

**What might change this calculus:**

- If traffic exceeded 1TB/month regularly (then costs would increase)
- If SEO required dynamic meta tags (then Lambda@Edge becomes necessary)
- If the site became a SPA requiring edge compute (then consider Vercel/Cloudflare Workers)

## Takeaways

### For Similar Situations

When deciding on hosting for static sites:

**Key factors to consider:**

1. Match compute to actual need—don&apos;t default to servers
2. Calculate cost at expected scale AND 10x scale
3. Value your time—automation pays for itself
4. Performance at edge beats optimized origin

**Red flags to watch for:**

- Running containers just to serve HTML files
- Manually deploying via FTP or SSH
- No HTTPS in 2024
- Skipping monitoring "because it&apos;s just a portfolio"

**Questions to ask upfront:**

- Does this content change per request? (If no, static)
- What&apos;s the acceptable deploy time? (Automation ROI)
- What&apos;s the traffic pattern? (Free tiers vs base costs)
- What signals do I want to send with this infrastructure?

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**

- Over-engineering with Kubernetes for a 10-page site
- Under-engineering with no automation or monitoring
- Ignoring security headers and best practices
- Not measuring what matters (TTFB, deploy time, cost)

### For Different Contexts

**When this approach wouldn&apos;t work:**

- Server-side rendering requirements (Next.js SSR, not SSG)
- Real-time features (WebSockets, live chat)
- Heavy compute needs (image processing, video encoding)
- Complex authentication flows
- Database-backed dynamic content

**What would need to be different:**

- Add Lambda@Edge or Lambda functions for dynamic features
- Use CloudFront Functions for lightweight edge compute
- Consider Amplify Hosting for fully managed Next.js/Gatsby
- Evaluate Cloudflare Workers for edge compute with better pricing

**Alternative strategies to consider:**

- **Vercel/Netlify**: Better DX for frameworks, similar architecture underneath
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Even cheaper, excellent DX, R2 storage
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, simpler, but less control
- **Render/Railway**: Good middle ground if you need some compute

### Timeless Principles

**Decision-making frameworks:**

1. Start with the problem, not the tool
2. Optimize for total cost (time + money + maintenance)
3. Choose boring technology that solves the problem
4. Match infrastructure to actual requirements
5. Automate anything you&apos;ll do more than twice

**Evaluation criteria:**

- Does this reduce cognitive load?
- Can I recreate this from code?
- What&apos;s the blast radius of failure?
- Am I learning transferable skills?

**Communication strategies:**

- Document decisions with context
- Share metrics, not feelings
- Make tradeoffs explicit
- Write README files future-you will thank you for

**Long-term thinking:**

- Infrastructure should enable, not constrain
- Optimize for change, not perfection
- Build for observability from day one
- Cost-awareness is a feature, not a constraint

### Looking Back

**What went as expected:**

- Cost stayed under $3/month consistently
- Performance exceeded targets (sub-50ms TTFB)
- Zero maintenance time spent on infrastructure
- Deploys became muscle memory

**What surprised me:**

- How much faster CloudFront is than "fast" VPS hosting
- S3&apos;s request costs are negligible (thousands of requests = pennies)
- Security headers and CSP were easier to implement than expected
- The portfolio itself became a conversation starter in interviews

**What I&apos;d do differently:**

- Start with Terraform from day one (I began with Console, migrated later)
- Set up CloudWatch alarms immediately (added them after launch)
- Enable S3 access logging from the start (useful for debugging)
- Document the architecture sooner (wrote it 6 months later)

**What reinforced my original thinking:**

- Static site generation is underrated
- CDNs are magical for the right use case
- Automation investment pays compound returns
- "Enterprise" is a mindset, not a price tag

---

**Actual measured results:**

- Average monthly cost: $1.73
- Average TTFB (North America): 38ms
- Average deploy time: 3m 24s
- Uptime (last 12 months): 99.98%
- Lighthouse performance score: 100
